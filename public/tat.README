A psychological test is a great tool that is used to observe the people who are responding to a variety of controlled conditions, which are designed to resemble real life, everyday incidents, and some unusual conditions. It is used to record the various emotional and behavioral reactions and the degree and manner of the person’s response.

These tests are conducted under time and space restriction, to get the individual’s unrestricted and free response to the situation. The basis of the test is that what the aspirant perceives and records are the projection of his self. Just like in the TAT or the Thematic Apperception Test; free association to a set of selected words as in Word Association Test (WAT); or to respond to verbally presented problem situations as in Situation Reaction Test (SRT). The TAT, WAT and SRT are the biggest hitters in the arsenal of the psychologist at the SSB.

So, now you know how you’re being assessed from a psychologist’s point of view; mould yourself accordingly. But remember, being determined, consistent and steady is the key to success.

2. Types of Psychological Tests in SSB
• Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
• Word Association Test (WAT)
• Situation Reaction Test (SRT)
• Self-Description Test (SDT)

(a) The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
Fact: 30% of the aspirants write preconceived story which doesn’t match the picture

Thematic Apperception Test is the second objective test employed by the SSBs to test the personality of the candidate. It is also a test of the candidate’s imagination. If an outline or hazy and vague picture is shown to a candidate, he will interpret it according to his imagination. These pictures, therefore, stimulate the thought processes of the candidate and he is able to weave around a story.

It is an attempt to let the candidate have flights of imagination. It is a method of exploring matter from a person’s subconscious mind by stimulating his fantasy and interpretation. The candidate is encouraged to come out with ideas and inner hidden or latent material which will not be available to normal.

I. Why Thematic Apperception Test?
This pictures originally employed for this purpose were very vague. There was a great play of projection or inner subconsciousness in the interpretation of these T.A.T pictures. Pictures with greater details and needing less play of projection and imagination were introduced by two psychologist, Murray and Margon, who used these in 1903 and the same are generally in use in India.

In TAT, the picture used by the SSBs are on the model of Murray’s pictures, but they are almost clear and not hazy. A set of 12 pictures is generally used including one blank slide. A slide of each picture is shown on a screen with the help of a projector for half a minute and the candidates are required to write a story based on the picture in a period of four minutes in the particular space provided on the answer sheet.

The TAT test is based on the theory that in the construction of stories around ambiguous pictures, the candidate organise material from his own personal experiences, partly as a result of the stimulus that he receives i.e. what he finds in the picture and partly his associations with such stimuli recalled from his past experiences.

II. Characteristics of the Story
The candidates must remember that there are certain essential elements or components of a well-constructed story. These are:
• The Hero: Each story must have a hero or the chief character with whom the writer identifies himself. The hero should exhibit qualities which an officer of the Armed Forces should possess. He should act and behave like a normal human being and not like a supernatural being.
• Other characters who help the hero in the execution of the task undertaken by him.
• Situation in the Story:
  ➤ What it is?
  ➤ How it came into being or what events led up to it?
  ➤ What will be the outcome or conclusion?
• The theme or plot:
  ➤ It is an attempt by the hero, assisted by other characters to organize the story by pooling all the resources at his disposal in order to successfully solve the problem by him.
  ➤ The plot should be interesting and end successfully.
  ➤ It should be self-evident. The reader must not remain in doubt about it or keep on guessing it.

- Sample Picture and Story:
  Rahul was a resident of Mumbai and he was studying in class 12. One day when he was in the school it started raining heavily. After the school was over he waited for the rain to be abated before he left for his home. While he was on his way back to home it started raining heavily. While he was waiting, he took shelter under a banyan tree near the road. While he was waiting, he saw a car that met with an accident with another car. People rushed to the spot and tried helping the victims. He too joined them and helped rescue a small girl, her parents and the driver of another car and rushed them to a hospital. Amid all this he did not realize that he was completely wet. After he reached home he had developed a high fever. His father called a doctor who came and examined Rahul. After 3 days Rahul was fit and fine to go to school and complete his studies.
  Requirements: The hero of your story is your alter ego. Therefore, you should have a set of similarities with your hero. These similarities can be in form of age, sex, and character. But there should a gap between you and your hero. You can have a difference of perception, emotion, and ability with the hero, but not in terms of achievements. The hero's achievements are a manifestation of your own.
