Fact: Only 20% of the aspirants from a batch complete all SRTs

The third test in the psychological test series, namely Situation Reaction Test aka SRT. As an officer in the Armed Forces is required to take decisions at the spur of the moment, for example the incident of Major Leetul Gogoi where he saved many lives with his quick decision and effective intelligence. It is important to check that how you would react to certain intricate and byzantine situations.

What is Situation Reaction Test?
Situation Reaction Test is largely a test of common sense. In everyday life one comes across certain unforeseen situations and is called upon to resolve them or find a solution for them and to act in an appropriate manner. Hence, a set of 60 incomplete situations are given to the candidates in the form of a test booklet. The candidate gets 30 minutes to complete the set of 60 incomplete situations. It means you get 30 seconds for each situation. In Situation Reaction Test you have to fight against time to complete the test.

A situation reaction test basically focuses on analyzing your personality based on your reaction to situations. The theory somewhat goes like this:
When you are in a situation of crisis, the aim is to be a leader there and solve it. How do you become a leader? By solving a crisis situation. The process of solving a situation has two aspects: Mental conviction and resource application.

In the former aspect, you are dealing with your belief in the activity you are doing, your faith in yourself to get it done, and the zeal to keep fighting. On the other hand, the application of resources is a crucial aspect of it. As a leader, you must know where, when and how you should be utilizing your resources. This is what constitutes a leader. You should have the will to perform and the skills to achieve the task.

(a) Key Points To Remember
- It is a test of your common sense.
- There are common situations pertaining to everyday life.
- Your responses should be practical and must be solvable by a normal human being.
- It is advised that you practice a set of SRTs (15-20) questions daily keeping the time limit in mind.
- If you cannot think of a response to a situation, it is better to let it go.
- Usually, the first response which comes to your mind is the best one.

Here the quality of your responses matters, candidates with only 30-
35 SRTs attempts have been recommended. So even if you complete
all 60 SRTs, it doesn't mean that your SRT was good.
Avoid leaving an SRT in between, it shows lack of decision making.

(b) How to Perform Well in SRT?
SRT tests the various aspirants for the normal happenings of the life and
the situations that may arise suddenly in one's life anytime. Situations
given in the series are such that can anytime happen with anyone
suddenly. You are provided with a booklet which has specially designed 60
questions by Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR). Each
question depicts a situation and has a blank which needs to be filled by the
taker of the exam as to what would be his/her reaction when such
situation comes in the life.
The best formula to do such questions is to just write solution that you
would opt for being a responsible citizen of the country. The following can
help in attempting such questions:

Make a note of this that you cannot leave any situation unhandled
but you have to provide a solution that is feasible by a human being
not by a super hero.
Be realistic and practical with your answers
Be truthful and don't try to fake as you are being tested at various
places for the same quality or say that same quality should come out
of your acts so never try to conceal anything.
Be brief in your solutions.
Also, there might be some questions repeated to check consistency,
just maintain that and don't show different solutions at such places
which gives the essence of fakeness.
Try to attempt as many questions as you want and don't try to escape
situations. That simply means you are thinking too much and
responding by faking results
Read the situation properly before answering to understand the
context of the place.
Quality of response matters not the quantity but this does not give the
freedom to think and write less. You score for more you write the
answers rightly.
Your solutions and qualities might be discussed at conference by all
the officers when they get together. So, they should get the same
person as it is when they go through the personality assessment.

• Also, it is suggested that you can refer books but should get your solutions assessed that whether they match your personality or not. Books (like this) only provide sample solutions.

• Also answer for one individual might not be correct for another individual because you should remember that through these answers you have to prove your qualities what you actually have in you. So, answers could be same but you should judge that you possess it or not.

Example:
She wants to go to a unknown city for higher education, but both the parents have different point of views and are quarrelling...

Solution
Sit with the parents and elders and discuss the situation with both merits and demerits.

(c) Most Common Situation Reaction and Mistakes

• He was on his way to home and suddenly it started raining heavily. He.
  ➤ You can simply say as he is going back on his car, so he will inform, drive safely and reach home. Stop exaggerating the heavy rain, heavy rain is not going to kill you.

• In his train compartment, two gunmen force passengers to give their belongings. He.
  ➤ Could be a routine checkup by RPF jawans, think of the most likely situation, to be practical, only two gunmen cannot loot the whole train, not even in Bollywood movies.

• He was in charge of a wireless board in a sailing ship which lost its communication with the coast. He.
  ➤ A ship normally faces communication problem, which is a normal scenario, being a ship encharge it is very easy for you to make it work again and use another communication system meanwhile. Again, think practically, if you were a normal passenger on that ship, then it will be a problem for you to fix it, but not for a ship in charge.

• During a trekking trip, he was left alone in the jungle. He.
  ➤ Use your mobile phone, yes will work in a normal Jungle where you would go for a trekking trip. Never saw someone putting live pictures of their trekking on Instagram and snapchat?

• He saw his girlfriend walking with another person on his way. He.
  ➤ You could go and meet your girlfriend and your girlfriend’s friend. You are so lucky to talk with two young girls, what else do you want! On a serious note, “person” could be a male or female, it all depends on how you perceive it. Be witty sometimes.

• He was playing outdoor and his brother got seriously injured and it started to rain heavily. He.
  ➤ Take out his car and go to hospital along with his injured brother and take care of him. No car? Take neighbors’ help and go to hospital in neighbor’s car along with his injured brother. Also, make sure you use “injured brother” this shows that your good in communication and more analytical.

• The leader of his trekking team decides to take a longer route when the time is running out. He.
  ➤ In this type of SRTs, be a good follower. You could say you would help the leader with your best ability and reach in time.

• He was walking on a dark street with his girlfriend then suddenly 10 armed people came & started harassing his girlfriend the next police station was 10km away. He…?
  ➤ As it says, next police station is 10 km, you are standing in front of a police station. Think cleverly.

(e) How to Complete 60 SRTs in 30 Mins
Situation Reaction Test (SRT) is largely a test of common sense. In day-to-day life, we come across certain unforeseen and unsought situations and we are called upon to resolve these and act in a suitable manner to meet the demand of the situation.

An Armed Forces officer comes across new, uncommon and inexperienced situations during his service career which can only be tackled if he has an alert mind, thinks logically and clearly, and gives quick decisions in those situations of stress and pressure without getting nervous.

SRT measures an individual in action and confronts him with situations related to own life, in response to which he expresses his feelings. This way, the individual reveals some of his personality traits through his performance and reflects his spontaneous techniques, reasoning ability and maturity of dealing with life situations preconceived by the psychologist.

Here we are providing few techniques to complete 60 SRTs in 30 minutes
• Write minimum possible words in your response, using action words and punctuation marks (Like a comma, full stop), it shortens the answer. Use telegraphic language. This saves time.
  ➤ For example: While going to college, he saw

- Don't write merely the reaction, write full action.
  - For example: While playing football, he twisted his ankle
    very badly. He...
    - Reaction: took first aid.
    - Complete action: took first aid, continued playing and won
      the match.
- It is very important to note that there is no right or wrong answer to
  any situation. There is a course of action to be followed which can
  differ from person to person. So don't waste your time finding the
  correct answer, just write whatever comes to your mind naturally but
  it should make sense.
- If for any situation, you have a lot of options in your mind, write the
  best one. For example, the situation is: He is good in studies but can't
  pay his college fee.... In this situation, you may want to write--
  somehow managed or managed from a friend, later returned
  him. With these answers, reflects your trait of dependency on others.
  Until it is very urgent or some other option is not available where you
  can't manage by self, don't write these. You may write, took a part
  time job or gave tuition classes.
- Although the situations given are simple but if by any chance you
  can't find a response to some uncommon situation, move on to the
  next one without wasting time. If you have time later, then think and
  write it down.
- If you find that a situation is repeated in some other form, then give
  the action differently but see it is not contradictory to the previous
  action.
- Always try and empathise yourself into the situation and then think
  for the solution. That way you think faster and respond.
- Manage your writing speed. For this, you need to focus and practice.
  Initially, start practicing without a clock and time. Try to improve your
  responses. As soon you see progress in your thinking process, try to
  be quicker in responding and put the time limit of 30 seconds to
  Remember to practice writing fast and legible too. Always remember
  that one learns to act appropriately to these situations by virtue of
  the experience one gains in life and not by the knowledge gained
  through classroom instruction. This is a natural and instinctive test
  of yours, don't mug up answers.
