Fact: 10% of the aspirants mess up the serial numbers of WAT responses.

Word Association Test is one among the psychological tests conducted by SSB. It is conducted on the Day-2, Stage 2 of the psychological test after TAT. In this test, psychologist wants to know that how the candidate associates any word. This is based on the principle of the subconscious mind. When a particular word is shown to a candidate the first thought that will come to his mind is always based upon his past experience and his association with the word. In this test the psychologist judges the same qualities inside the candidates as that of TAT.

Word Association Test (WAT) is one of the projective approaches which is employed by the psychologists for their clinical diagnosis. It is a test of personality, imagination and mental function of the candidate. The candidates are presented with a list of words, one at a time and asked to respond with the first idea or thought that strikes their mind. This test is also known as idea writing test. The words in WAT are designed and arranged in a manner to attract spontaneous reaction of the candidate, which helps the psychologist read a candidate’s personality traits. Each candidate has a different perception of a given word and on its basis, he associates his thoughts with that word. These thoughts are influenced by his environment. For the same word; different feelings, thoughts, images may be aroused or triggered in different people. With the help of this test, the psychologist understands or gets a fair idea of the candidate’s personality, his likes and dislikes, achievements, emotional attitudes and temperament.

There will be 60 words in WAT. There is no fixed type of words. But usually those types of words come in this test which we use in our day to day life. Here the time given to write the complete sentence is very less i.e. candidates will only get 15 seconds for reading the word from the screen and write complete sentence based on that particular word on the answer sheet provided to them. After 15 seconds, a new word will appear on the screen. The candidate has to repeat the same procedure and it goes on. 60 such words will appear on the screen.

The time is kept so short for a particular reason — to get the true attitude out from the candidates. In this short time duration candidate has to respond with the first idea that comes in his/her mind after reading the word on screen. That is his/her true response.

I. Points to Remember

• It is not a test of language or grammar, so do not worry about the beauty of the sentence, concentrate on the correct ideas.
• You are advised to write the first idea which comes to your mind when you see the word. Try to remain natural
• Avoid using phrases or short forms. Try to form a complete sentence
• You are not required to define or convey the meaning of the word. You are required to associate the first thought which comes to your mind with the word.
• Please do not memorize readymade words.
• You can use the same word or you can use its derivatives. Eg- happy, happiness, happily
• Write positive constructive and meaningful sentences.
• Do not write negative and anti-social responses.
• Try and write short sentences to come up trump with the time.
• It is very easy to construct sentences using 'I'. Try to limit the use of this word as it shows a lack of imagination and effort nor does it signify a thorough provoking idea. The sentences are supposed to convey a good and positive practical message. For example: for the word friend, don't make sentence like I am very friendly or I have many friends. Instead, you should make sentences like, one must choose friends carefully, or friends are trustworthy, etc.

Let's see an example
Word: Plan
Response: Good game plan is vital for team victory
Interpretation: Here the word was PLAN and your response to it was about game plan. This shows that you go above and beyond the word. You have also associated your team with victory, which may give you extra points in the eyes of the psychologist.

let's take a look at some of the words
Word: Power
Response: Indian Army is powerful
Interpretation: This response does not specify if you are stating the fact, or pointing towards a specific power of the army.
Good Response: Indian Army is boosting its artillery power with M777 Ultralight Howitzers

Interpretation: We are appreciating the strength and decision of the Indian army.

Grading Of The Sentences
Let us take a look at how your sentences are graded in WAT
N-1,2,3 (means Neutral one, two, three)
P-1,2,3 (means Positive one, two, three)
HP (means Highly Positive one)

II. Can I leave a word blank in between?
If you want to leave a response in between because you are blank make sure you follow some precautions
- Try to leave the word with respect to the serial to maintain the similarity.
- Even if you cannot finish the sentence, at least try to write something.
- Never give another word as a response as it might give a wrong impression that you do not want.
- What you write should be practical and show your knowledge.

III. Make Better Sentences In WAT
Personality traits like Initiative, Loyalty, Liveliness, Leadership, Adaptability, Cooperative Spirit, Intelligence, Courage, Determination, Team Spirit, Spirit of adventure, Hard work, Organizational ability, Sociability, Resourcefulness, Self-confidence, Fearlessness, Sense of justice, Sense of duty and responsibility, Unselfishness (all a part of OLQs) are reflected by a candidate's response.

Some tips to form better sentences in Word Association Test (WAT)
- Be spontaneous, and not studied: Your response should be voluntary and unconstrained. You may forget the mugged-up sentences, your spontaneous reactions reflect your qualities whether you are fit to be an officer or not. Remember it is not a test of language but personality.
- Practice helps: It is always useful. It helps you in making the right and quick response to words set for WAT with spontaneity. You will be able to avoid pitfalls in the SSB tests if you have done some practice for WAT exercises.
- Selection of words: The SSBs select such words for WAT that bring out particular officer like qualities. The words can be of two types:
  i) Knowledge based—Words in this category imply observational sentences. Not necessarily they trigger
...spontaneous stimuli and are conventional in type. For example: Missile, Atom, Keyboard, Ice, Kitchen, Money, Diamonds etc.
➤ Character based- Words in this category activate and stimulate your responses. You demonstrate your OLQs mostly from these types of words. For example, Peace, Love, Anger, Brave, Admire, Initiative, Think, Youth, etc.

• So practice more with such kind of words and analyse yourself with OLQ list. Within a few days, you will notice changes in your pattern of responses which also reflect in your normal life. Also, do not try to associate every word with Defence career, it only indicates the psychologist that the reactions are not natural and the candidate has been wrongly coached.

• Write short, crisp and meaningful: Write simple and brief sentences to save time. There is no need to use articles in every sentence. Make meaningful and logical sentences, don't use a lot of imaginary power, your sentences must be real and grounded.

• Free of grammatical errors & legible handwriting: Write grammatically correct sentences and maintain a good handwriting. This is a test of pressure, your ability to stay calm and composed is revealed from your written work. A candidate struggling to write sentences with a poor handwriting and scribbling responses is more likely to be knocked off from the pressure test.

• Creativity & Originality: When a word flashes on the screen, record the first image that comes to your mind associated with that word. This is your original idea of the word. Now write a positive sentence from that word or relate it to a story and jot it down on your answer sheet.

• Do not use modal verbs: Remember not to use words like can, could, may, might, should, must, ought to. They express likelihood, ability or permission and form the basis of imaginary sentences.

• Use remedial or denial approach for negative words: Never form sentences showing negative traits like pessimism, anti-social feelings. In Remedial approach, a remedial or curative word is used as a starting word showing its remedial effect over the negative word. In Denial approach, along with the negative word, denial expression is used. In this technique, words like no, never, do not, not, etc can be used to form sentences.

For example- Hate

Using denial approach: Never pays in a relationship.

Using remedial approach: Love overcomes hatred.

• In case of less time or inability to complete a sentence: If you fall short of time or if, for some words, you are not able to form full sentences, write your idea or immediate reaction about that sentence in a word or two. The psychologist will understand what you want to convey. For example, for the word Sports, if you are unable to complete the sentence in time, just write "adventurous". The psychologist will derive the conclusion that by adventurous you mean something about adventurous sports or that sports is adventurous.

• The last thing about succeeding in WAT is always try to demonstrate and express positive attitude with the feeling of determination and dedication.

IV. Negative Words in WAT

Psychological or psychometric testing is based on the principles of projective testing. The psychological testing consists of WAT, TAT, SRT, SD. These tests are important because the psychologist extracts the map representation of the candidate's character/attitude and qualities.

Word Association Test (WAT) is a test of imagination. And it's absolutely imperative to test the personality of the candidate through his/her imaginative ideas about men and matters. The psychologist assesses the personality of the candidates by showing them words of different kinds. The same words arouse different ideas, feelings, and emotions in different people. Therefore, one word becomes a peephole into different personalities.

So, it is not recommended to cram up the reactions noted down in books. But you can always seek guidance from people, professional mentors, etc. You can practice WAT by yourself at home using timers.

Moving forward to WAT, there are two kinds of words that are projected in SSBs, namely—Positive words and Negative words. Some candidates find it difficult to tackle the negative words because we tend to react positively to a negative word but somehow in the stipulated word of 15 seconds and extreme pressure exerted; we generally do not perform the way we want to.

So, in this article, we shall describe three ways to form a positive idea from a negative word on the slides.

Now, when you find the word Hate flashed on the projector, the first image that comes to your mind is a feeling of dislike or revenge. The word


Defeat draws the sketch of failure in our thoughts. This is natural but you need to do a little practice to transform those images into a positive frame.
Denial method: Along with the negative word denial expression is used to deny the existence of the negative word. For this type, words like does not, do, never are used with the sentence.
• Deni al words (is not, does not, syntax: TPSN (third person singular noun) + Denial words (is not, does not, has not, never) + OW (Original word) + Other words.
Examples:
• Hate: Never pays in a relationship.
• Good friends never hate each other.
• Good understanding never creates hatred.
Use of antonyms: Instead of the original word, its antonym can be used in the sentence.
Example:
• Hate: Loving people brings them closer to us.
Remedial method: A remedial or curative word is used as a starting word showing its remedial effect for the negative word. Words like removes, overcomes, cures, eliminates, etc. can be used.
syntax: RW (Remedial word) + removes/overcomes/cures + OW (Original word)
Examples:
• Hate: Love cures hatred.
• Sorrow: Joy overcomes sorrow.
Some examples of negative words:
Sad: Happiness overcomes sadness.
Harm: A teacher never harms his own students.
Failure: Success overcomes failure.
Vices: Virtues remove vices.
Shy: Frankness eliminates shyness.
Reject: A brave never rejects challenges of life.
Suicide: Courage removes the feeling of suicide.
Bomb: High alert overcomes bomb explosion.
Fear: Winners bravely face their fear.
Dismiss: A good leader never dismisses a good idea.
Snake: Snake poison is useful for medical purposes.
Knife: Knife is a useful instrument for a surgeon.
Cruel: Kindness overcomes cruelty.
Blame: An officer never blames the innocent.
Fight: She doesn’t fight with her siblings.
